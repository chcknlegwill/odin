  <p>Buttermilk Pancakes mmmmmm.</p>
  <ul>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <li>Flour: All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.</li>
    <li>Sugar: Three tablespoons.</li>
    <li>Leaveners: Baking powder and baking soda.</li>
    <li>Salt: Just a small amount (however you want)</li>
    <li>Buttermilk: 3 cups.</li>
    <li>Milk: wholemilk helps with batter consistency.</li>
    <li>Eggs: three whole eggs.</li>
    <li>Butter: Melted butter.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
    <li>Make the pancakes: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
